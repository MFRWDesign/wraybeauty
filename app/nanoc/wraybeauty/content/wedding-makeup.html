      <p class="bulgarian-garmond-italic">"Nina made my wedding a dream come true with the exquisite makeup she provided for my mother and me. She not only made us both feel completely beautiful and well cared for but she explained the process and made us feel completely comfortable. She was extremely professional and provided quality work that all my guests wowed over. I could not have been happier with how my makeup looked for my wedding!! Both my mother and I were 100% satisfied. I highly recommend Nina to all who want a quality makeup artist."</p>
