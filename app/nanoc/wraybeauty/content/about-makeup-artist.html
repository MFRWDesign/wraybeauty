    <h3>Making Beauty and Confidence Your Reality</h3>

    <p>Wray Beauty technically began when I was a teenager experimenting with makeup in front of my bedroom mirror. It has since become a dream career of helping others achieve the skills and confidence to look and feel their best.</p>
    <p>I’m still consistently trying new products (much to the dismay of my over-packed shelves) and talking about the best ones with whoever wants to listen. I’ve combined my love of makeup and the art of application with my passion for people and creating a fun, comfortable atmosphere.  My favorite part of the job is not only helping you look your best, but also teaching how you can do this for yourself on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>I’m warm, friendly and genuinely excited about each one of my clients. Whether you want to feel fabulous for a night out, create a time efficient routine for your workday, or want the look that’s going to give you the perfect pictures; Wray Beauty can help.  As a bonus you’re guaranteed to have a lot of fun in the process.</p>
